# Let's Make it Look Good

Last time we made some `HTML` but it did not look good. We use CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets to make it look good.

> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet

Here is some css.

```css
div {
 margin-top: 12px;
 margin-bottom: 12px;
 margin-left: 12px;
 margin-right: 12px;
 background: aqua;
 color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

The first line `div {` contains the selectors, `div` it's the thing we want to apply the style to. The opening curly brace, `{` is the start of the styles that will be applied to the selector. The last line, the closing curly brace `}` is just saying this definition is done. 

If you look at the stuff between the curly braces you will see a pattern, `background: aqua;` these parts how we want to change the selected elements. These are called declarations and have two parts the property, `background`, and the value, `aqua`.
